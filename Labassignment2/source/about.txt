    <h2>Project Overview</h2>
    <li>
        In this project  a digital image is superimposed on a scene from the real world, creating a view that is part reality and part virtual reality.
        It can be used in newspapers and other types of print media.
    </li>

    <li>
        When augmented reality is used with a newspaper, a photo in an article is scanned with the camera of a mobile device.
    </li>
    <li>
        The AR software identifies the photo and then loads related digital content. The content is displayed in the device's camera view.
    </li>
    <li>
        It's often positioned over the scanned photo so that the digital content appears to have replaced the photo.
    </li>
